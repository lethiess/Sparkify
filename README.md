# Sparkify

This is the Capstone project of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree programm. This project repository provides a Jupyter Notebook with multiple Machine Learning models for preditcting the user churn of a music streaming service called Sparkify. For more information about this project please take a look at this blogpost [here](https://lethiess.medium.com/how-to-detect-user-churn-in-a-early-state-4a51e52c37e7).

The notebook contains following parts:
* Data Exploration
* Feature Creation
* Predicting user churn with Machine Learning

### Installation
